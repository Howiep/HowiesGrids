                    The first of the month is coming, we have to get money, we have no choice. It cost money to eat and they don’t want you to
                    eat. We the best. To be successful you’ve got to work hard, to make history, simple, you’ve got to make
                    it. Put it this way, it took me twenty five years to get these plants, twenty five years of blood sweat
                    and tears, and I’m never giving up, I’m just getting started. They will try to close the door on you,
                    just open it.

                    Special cloth alert. You see that bamboo behind me though, you see that bamboo? Ain’t nothin’ like bamboo. Bless up. Stay
                    focused. The key is to drink coconut, fresh coconut, trust me. Learning is cool, but knowing is better,
                    and I know the key to success. We don’t see them, we will never see them. It’s on you how you want to
                    live your life. Everyone has a choice. I pick my choice, squeaky clean. Surround yourself with angels.
                    Another one.
